# Today's Workflow - Trax Radio Development

## Current Status: COMPLETED âœ…

### Professional UI Styling - COMPLETED âœ…
- **Widget Borders**: All widgets (Metadata, Current DJ, Next DJ) now have 4px thick borders
- **Consistent Width**: All three widgets fill available width with `width: double.infinity`
- **Scrolling Text**: Metadata widget has left-to-right scrolling "Artist - Title" text
- **Overflow Handling**: "LIVE" badge properly contained within widget borders
- **Local Preservation**: All styling changes saved locally in working files

### Visualizer Enhancements - COMPLETED âœ…
- **Improved Beat Detection**: Enhanced BPM service with multi-frequency analysis
- **Better Audio Analysis**: Multiple time windows, outlier filtering, weighted averaging
- **Simplified Pulse System**: Reverted to reliable fixed 500ms pulse (1.0 to 1.15 scale)
- **Controlled Bar Expansion**: Limited max height to 60% to prevent excessive expansion
- **Frequency-Based Colors**: Red (bass), Orange (mid), Yellow (high) frequency ranges
- **Responsive Animation**: 50ms update frequency for smooth real-time response
- **State Management**: Proper start/stop behavior based on playing state

### Layout Improvements - COMPLETED âœ…
- **Turntable Positioning**: Positioned above play button with 1px spacing
- **Widget Stacking**: Metadata, Current DJ, Next DJ widgets above turntable with 1px spacing
- **Visualizer Spacing**: Optimized positioning and bar height (180px)
- **Clean Interface**: Removed version number and developer info from main screen
- **Responsive Design**: Maintains reactive layout for different devices
- **Turntable Widget**: Perfect record alignment and sizing (0.77 factor, precise positioning)

### Performance Optimization - IN PROGRESS ðŸŸ¡
- **Memory Allocation**: Preparing to increase Cursor memory to 24GB for 80GB system
- **Git Pager Fix**: Will fix terminal hanging issues with git commands
- **Cursor Restart**: Planned restart to apply new memory settings
- **Git Merge**: Ready to merge with Beta V1 branch after optimization

## App State: IN DEVELOPMENT ðŸŸ¡
- **Local Preservation**: All styling and visualizer changes saved locally
- **Working Features**: All widgets display correctly with professional styling
- **Visualizer**: Bars animate smoothly, pulse works reliably
- **Audio Integration**: BPM service provides real-time beat detection
- **UI Consistency**: All widgets have uniform 4px borders and proper spacing
- **Turntable**: Record perfectly aligned and sized with smooth rotation animation

## Next Steps: CONTINUE DEVELOPMENT ðŸŸ¡
- **Further Testing**: App needs more internal testing and refinement
- **Performance**: Continue optimizing animations and state management
- **Reliability**: Ensure all features work consistently across devices
- **Documentation**: Keep updating as development continues
