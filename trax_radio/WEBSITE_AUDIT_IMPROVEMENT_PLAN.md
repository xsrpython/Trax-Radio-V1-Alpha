# Trax Radio UK Website Audit & Improvement Plan

## Executive Summary
This report delivers a thorough audit of Trax Radio UK's website, meta tags, and social media footprint. Key findings highlight strong brand identity and genre-focused content but reveal gaps in SEO optimization, site usability, and social engagement. The accompanying action plan outlines prioritized steps—ranging from immediate meta-tag enhancements to long-term content and social strategies—to boost discoverability, user experience, and community growth.

## 1. Website Overview

### Brand & Content Strengths
- Clear positioning as "The UK's Oldest Independent Dance Music Radio Station"
- 24/7 live DJ schedule prominently displayed
- Multiple listening options (Mixcloud catch-up, sister stations)

### User Experience Opportunities
- Navigation could be streamlined with a sticky header and clear "Listen Now" CTAs
- No visible newsletter or mailing-list sign-up
- Events and show schedule lack calendar integration or reminders
- Mobile layout is serviceable but could benefit from a refreshed, mobile-first design

### Performance & Accessibility
- Page-speed improvements: optimize images, leverage browser caching
- Ensure all images have descriptive alt attributes
- Verify SSL configuration and accessibility compliance (ARIA labels, contrast ratios)

## 2. SEO & Meta-Tag Analysis

### Current Meta Elements
| Element | Value | Source |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Title | Trax Radio – The UK's Oldest Independent Dance Music Radio Station | Homepage |
| Meta description | None detected | — |
| OpenGraph | None | — |
| Twitter Card | None | — |
| Canonical | None | — |
| Schema.org JSON-LD | None | — |

### Recommendations
1. **Meta Description**: Craft a 150–160 character summary incorporating target keywords (e.g., "UK dance music radio", "24/7 live DJ mixes").
2. **Canonical Tag**: Add `<link rel="canonical" href="https://trax-radio-uk.com/" />` to prevent duplicate-content issues.
3. **Robots Meta**: Ensure index, follow is set globally, with no noindex on core pages.
4. **OpenGraph & Twitter Cards**: Implement og:title, og:description, og:image, og:url, and twitter:card with summary_large_image.
5. **Structured Data**: Use JSON-LD to mark up as RadioStation (Schema.org) with name, url, logo, sameAs (social URLs).

## 3. Social Media Presence & Improvement

| Platform | Current Status |
|----------|----------------|
| Twitter | 3 followers; sparse tweets; 12 posts to date |
| Facebook | 251 page likes; 17 active discussions; no pinned announcements |
| Mixcloud | 2,930 following; 1,925 followers; frequent show uploads |
| Instagram & TikTok | Linked via Linktree but no official station profiles; minimal content |
| Twitch | Active channel for livestreams; chat integration but under-promoted |

### Growth Strategies
- **Content Cadence**: Publish a consistent weekly schedule: teasers for upcoming DJs, event recaps, audience polls.
- **Cross-Platform Promotion**: Embed Mixcloud and Twitch widgets on the site; auto-share show start and end times across Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram Stories.
- **Influencer Collaborations**: Partner with UK dance music bloggers and micro-influencers for guest DJ takeovers.
- **Community Engagement**: Launch a #TraxFamily hashtag campaign; share user-generated content (home mixes, dance clips).
- **Paid Social**: Test small-budget Facebook and Instagram boosts for marquee shows or events.
